This application is written in android studio

This application takes only outlook email addresses; @hotmail.com, etc.

Please enter correct email and password as I did not have enough time to confirm if email and password are correct.

After you login, click on the send button which is at the top left corner of the screen.

Ones you are in the send activity. type an email you would like to send a message to, also provide a subject and a message. 

When done click send and wait for the message to be send. After the massage has been send you will be redirected to the main inbox activity.


Note:
I have commented out the method that calls receive emails. Because the background thread of receive emails was crashing the send email background thread.
